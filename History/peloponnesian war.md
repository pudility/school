# peloponnesian war

### Athens vs. Sparta

- Pericles realized:
  - athen was dominant power therefore we dont have to beat Sparta, they have to beat us - we win a tie
  - athens was a **thalassocracy**. Dual meaning: rule of the sea 
- the primary ships where **trireme**s. 
  - the ships where not rowed by slaves.
  - the ships tried to ram the other ships, not shooting
  - they could not leave it in the water over night because the wood was not seasoned.
- periclese did not fight on the land, he pulled everyon onto the land and then fiaugh on the land
- In 430 BC the plague hit Athens (maybe typhoid feaver)
- Pericles and his sons both die of the plague
- the eulogy (a speach a a funiral) 
  - the greeks loved speeches. 
  - Two magor parts:
    - Epaineses: lots of nice things of the dead
      - Logoslergon: we speak of their heroic deeds
      - Dikaion: "Your sad, its ok to be sad."
      - Progonoi: talk about ancestry.
      - Autochthones: they signed up for this
      - Paideia: they where prepared for this
      - Politeia: ours is a heroic people
      - Arete: they made there fathers proud.
    - Parineses: instructions to the living
      - Paramythetikon: living shoild be comforted by the memory of them
      - Protreptikon: it is now up to you of the sacrifice.
