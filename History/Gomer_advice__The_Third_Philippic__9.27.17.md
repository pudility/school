1. What could Gomer do to better coordinate and motivate his team members with time running out?

He could ask his group to do their work. And he could offer to help or show them what they need to do. He could also try to make a compromise, and show them what he is doing vs. what they are doing. He could try to convince them to do the work if not for themselves for the others in the group.

2. If it finally becomes a choice between having everyone do their fair share and the assignment not getting completed at all, which should Gomer pick and why?

This depends on the amount of work there is, I would say if there is less than and hour or two just do it. I would say no matter what he should talk to the teacher about the situation, that way he may be able to save his grade even if the project is not a success.

3. Now take a look on Schoology at Demosthenesâ€™ *Third Philipic*. Skim the first few paragraphs and look at what he says about leadership. Pick a sentence that shows he might agree with your answers above. Copy it down, and then explain why it shows that. 

> Some of them, men of Athens, so long as they can maintain the conditions which bring them reputation and influence, take no thought for the future and therefore think that you also should take none, while others, by accusing and slandering those who are actively at work, are simply trying to make the city spend its energies in punishing the members of its own body, and so leave Philip free to say and do what he likes.

Here he is saying that the men of athens don't do anything to protect their future if they are still getting reputation. So basicly, if its not effecting them **right now** they don't really care about it. I think this is similar to what Gomer is going through because the people in his group don't really care about what happens to their future grade if it is not affecting them right now. Demosthenes then goes on to say that if they continue not to care then Philip will be "free to say and do what he likes" (e.g., take over athens). This is similar to the advice that I gave when I said that he could try to convince them to do the work if not for themselves for the others in the group. And when I said if they continue not to care then everyone will get a bad grade.
