### What is evaporation?

Evaporation is when water heats up and turns into mist that evaporates into the sky and sometimes forms cloudes that then rain the water back down to us.

### What is happening at teh molecular level during evaporation?

I am not quite sure, but I think that the hydrogen and oxogyn are heating up and expanding.

### what is condensation?

It is water that sticks to the side of a cold glass on a hot day. I think it is water that is attracted to other water at difforent tempatures, but I am not quite sure why condensation happens.

### What is happening at the modecular level during condensation?

I have no idea, but I think it might be hydrogyn bonding with oxogyn in the air and craeting more water.

### What is a cloud made of?

Water vapor that has evaporated.
