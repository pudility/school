#Geometry

###Vocab

- Planes have two dimensions, lenght and width.
- Planes can be specified by a letter with **no dot**.
- Points are coplaner if they lie on the same plane. 
- Any three points **are** coplaner.
  - if there are three points that are non-coliniar they must be complaner.
- Space is a set of all points.
  - Space is 3 dimensional 
- Any solid figure is a space figure


- A line goes on forever in two directions and has zero end points. 

- a segment starts at one point and ends at another.

- a ray starts at one point and continues on forever.

- Collinear means that points lie on the same line.
   - if there are only two points, they **must** be collinear, because you can always put a line through them 

- Lines are named using any two points on the line. The order doesn't matter. 

- Lines must have the below shape above them.

$$
\overleftrightarrow{YC}
$$

- parallel, two lines that run next to eachother for ever. the **never intersect eachother**

- Angle:

  - > a figure composed of two rays sharing a common endpoint

- Circle (and non-circle) cheat sheet:

## Measuring angles

| Name                      | Degree   |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| Acute Angles              | 1 - 89   |
| Right Angles              | 90       |
| Obtuse Angles             | 91 - 179 |
| Straight Angle            | 180      |
| 180 < Reflex Angle < 360  | --       |
| Full Circle or Full Angle | 360      |



* To solve for *x* angles, change the degrees into numbers and compair like so:

  ![SolveForX](/Users/zoe/Documents/Math/ImageAssets/SolveForX.png)

​        3x + 178 = 6x + 238

​	178 = 3x + 238

​	0 = 3x + 60

​	-3x = 60

​	-x = 20

​	x = -20

* when given a problem like this, you may solve using the following: 

  find *qpr* (25)

  ![SolveForAngel](/Users/zoe/Documents/Math/ImageAssets/SolveForAngel.png)

  ​qps = 40

  ​rps = 8x + 7

  ​qpr = 9x + 16

---

​	8x + 7 +  9x + 16 = 40

​	17x + 23 = 40

​	17x = 17

​	**x = 1**

* When one line goes through two parelel lines, it creates two pairs of identical arrows. Here is an example:

* Inorder to solve a problem like this:

  ![QuadLinePartOne](/Users/zoe/Documents/Math/ImageAssets/QuadLinePartOne.png)

* Inorder To solve this, first we need to remember that the full circle is 360, therfore line
  $$
  \overleftrightarrow{NQ}
  $$

  * is equal to 180 degrees and therfore `c = 180 - b`.
    $$
    \overleftrightarrow{MP}
    $$

  * is also equal to `180 - b` 

  * and this answers our final question, witch is that `c = a `

* when more than two lines intersect, you can subtract known angesl to find a variable, for example:

  ![subtractingAngles](/Users/zoe/Documents/Math/ImageAssets/subtractingAngles.png)

  we know that:

  * angel `CB = 90` 
  * `CB = AD` 
  * `FD = 90 - AF`
  * `AF = 73`
  * `FD = 90 - 73 = 17`
  * `FD + AF = AD`
  * `AD = CB`
  * `CE = FD`

  Therfore `CE = 17 = x` and we have our answer!

* NOTE: trinagles angles all **add up to `180`**

* Inorder to find the interior angles on a polygon like the one below

  ![InteriorAngles](/Users/zoe/Documents/Math/ImageAssets/InteriorAngles.png)

  We multiply the number of sides by `180` then we just subtract `360` and get our answer. In this case `180 * 5 = 900` and `900 - 360 = 540` therfore our answer is `540`.

  Here is a more detailed explanation:

* Triangles:

  * any one side of a triangle must be shorter than the other two combined

  * Example:

    ![triangleSideLengths](/Users/zoe/Documents/Math/ImageAssets/triangleSideLengths.png)

    * `3.2 + 5.5 = 8.7` => therfore `x < 8.7`
    * `5.5 − 3.2 = 2.3` => therfore `x > 2.3`

  * Area of triangles

    * Take the followign triangle:

      ![TriangleArea](/Users/zoe/Documents/Math/ImageAssets/TriangleArea.png)

    * this triangle is half a parallelogram.

    * the area of the parallelagram is width*height or `10 * 8`

    * therefore our triangle has an area of `1/2⋅(b ↓1 + b ↓2)⋅h` or `40`

* Trapazoids

  * Formula: Area = `21⋅(b1+b2)⋅h`

  * Example on how to find the area

    ![trapezoidArea](/Users/zoe/Documents/Math/ImageAssets/trapezoidArea.png)

  * now we aplly the formula: `1/2⋅(4 + 7)⋅4` = `22`

* Triangles on a grid:

  * find the bigger rectangle:

    ![TriangleOnGrid](/Users/zoe/Documents/Math/ImageAssets/TriangleOnGrid.png)

  * then we add the area of the three right triangles:

    * `3` = 2*3/2
    * `2` = 1*4/2
    * `4` = 2*4/2

  * now we just subtract that from our square to get our final answer wich is `7`

* Radios = half diamater

* diamater is the langth between two sides of the circle

* Area of a circle is `π * r ^ 2` EX:

  * Radios 2:
  * `π * 2 ^ 2`

* Radios is circumfrence devided by 2π 

* circumference is 2π * radius
