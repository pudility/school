This is a segment:

Absolute value -- Ruler postulate

​	→ How to use a ruler:

---

The mid point can only be on a line segment, and is the point that devides the segment into two congruent segments. 

---

(~=) is congruent two:
$$
\cong
$$

Segment addition postulate:

if A,B, & C are collinear then:

AB + BC = AC

2x + 3 + 5x - 4 = 27

7x - 1 = 27

7x = 28

x = 4
