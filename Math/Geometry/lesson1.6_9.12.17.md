Angle AOB can be expressed like this:
$$
\angle AOB
$$
or like this:
$$
\angle O
$$
or even like this:
$$
\angle 1
$$
and if you have something like angle ABCO, you can epress the two difforent angles with 1,2.

---

when talking about the points of an agnle you use angle, but if you are talking about degreese use the "measure" (numerical measurement) of an angle like this:
$$
M\angle AOB
$$
to express the congruncy of two angles you can do the following:
$$
\angle 1\cong \angle2
$$

---

- when two lines intersect to form 2 pairs of opp. Rays, then vertical angles are formed.

- adjacent angles share a common side.

- angles are complementary if the sum of ther angle messures is 90 (dgrees) EX:

  - $$
    \angle50 ^{\circ} and \angle40 ^{\circ}
    $$

- Two angles are called supplementary if the sum of their angle measures is 180

  - to remember, c comes before s and 90 comes before 180

---

- if 3 rays lie in the same plane, the 

- $$
  M\angle AOB + M \angle BOC = M \angle AOC
  $$

  and:
  $$
  M\angle 1 + M\angle2 = M \angle AOC
  $$
