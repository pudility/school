### Our article talked about how storms have to do with climate change.

- It is not a simple matter

- The science linking hurricanes to climate change is still developing.

  > the trend signal has not yet had time to rise above the background variability of natural processes

- If the world gets warmer this **should** make the huricanes/storms more intense even if it does not effect the **number** or actual storms.

- The flooding can be even more dangerois than the storm it's self.

- > storm surge is made worse by sea level rise, which we are certain humans have contributed to.
