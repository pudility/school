### Conditional statement

Any statment that can be writen in the form of: `if ... then`. 
$$
if\space =>{hypothesis},\space then\space => {conclusion}
$$
truth value, can be true or false. 

---

EXAMPLE

- if today is Wednesday, then tomarrow is thursday

  Truth value: **true**

- `if x^2=4, then x=2` 

  Truth value: **false** (`x=-2`)

- :

- $$
  if \space x^2 = 4, \space then \space x = \pm \space 2
  $$

  Truth value: **true**

---

- If a, Then b.
- a implies b
- a --> b

---

### converse statment

- of a conditional statment

it is the reverse of an if statement

to form a converse, just switch the hypothesis and the conclusion.

`B implies A`

---

## EXAMPELS

Conditional:
$$
if \space 2x-5 = 7 \space\space\space then\space x = 6 => True
$$
Converse:
$$
if \space x = 6 \space\space\space then \space 2x-5 = 7 => True
$$
