A line segments consists of two points called end points and all of the points in between.



Line segmants can be expressed like so:
$$
\over{A}
$$
and rays can expressed like so:
$$
\overrightarrow{AB}
$$
and as stated before lines can be exrpessed like this:
$$
\overleftrightarrow{AB}
$$


Opposite rays are **two** rays taht are collinear and have a common endpoint (note the size is messed up but it should not be).


$$
\overleftarrow{B} - \overline{A} - \overrightarrow{A}
$$
Skew lines mean that two lines are not in the same plane.

parallel lines are lines that are in the same plane and do not intersect. Like so:
$$
\leftarrow \rightarrow \rightarrow M
$$

$$
\leftarrow \rightarrow \rightarrow L
$$

is parrelel to: `L||M`

---

skew lines are lines that lie in different planes and do not intersect.

### there **cannot be** skew planes.

parrallel planes will never intersect.

NOTE: planes cannot be skew.
