1) `5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160` doubbling. 

3) `1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3,4` counting up by one, every other number is negative.

6) `81, 27, 9, 3, 1, 1/3` deviding by three.

9) `1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040 `  n `x` last answer. 

LOGIC:

on the left is the answer the the one before it

on the right is the number of the problem (n)

- `1*1` = 1
- `1*2` = 2
- `2*3` = 6

12) `1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6` adding one to the denominator.

15) Goerge, Thomas, Abe, Alexander, Andrew, Ulysses - Names of people on bills. NOTE: **I had to google this one**.

18) See paper - adding a square to the middle that is rotated by 90 degrees.

21) They are all divisible by two? (I was not quite sure how to do this one) 

24) `123454321`

27) `1, 10` - the difforence is` 9` wich is more than` 1`.

30) 10, 14, 19, 25... 160: the `n-1` value  + *n* + `3` 

33) `0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001` - `n/10`

36)~~`0, 1/2, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, ` - The numorator is `(n * 2) - 1` and the denomonator is `n * 2`~~ wait that won't work. I have no idea, I have spent half an hour on this problem alone and I still have no idea.

39) H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne... - I know this one! Its the periodic table!

42) See paper - Add one more angle onto the figure in the circle.

45) See paper - Rotate by 90 Degrees and add one line to the oposite corner.
