If two pts lie on the same horizontal or vertical line we can find the distance vetween them using the ruler postulate.

- but waht if A and B are not on the smae horizontal or vertical line?

---

### DISTANCE FORMULA

$$
d = \sqrt{(x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2}
$$

---

### MIDPOINT FORMULA

$$
average(x, y) = ({x1 + x2\over{2}}, {y1 + y2\over{2}})
$$
