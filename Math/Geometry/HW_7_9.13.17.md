6) See Paper

9) **Accute**, 60°

12) **Obtuse**, 130°

15) 
$$
\angle DOC
$$

18)
$$
\angle DOC
$$

---

21) **30°** 

---

24) **Yes**, it is symmetrical and it has the equal signs on the langth and they share the other line segment.

---

27) **True** because each angle is 90° and `2 * 90 = 180`.

---

30) **True** because the triangle is symmetrical and *C* is a point on the line of cemetery

---

33) **115**, beacuse *ACB* is supplementary to *BCD* and *ACB* = 65 therfore `180 - 65 = 115` and we have our answer.

---

36) **150**, because each 5 minute segment would be 30° and 6 oclock would be 180° and `180 - 30 = 150`

---

39) **30°**, because as I stated above each 5 minute time segment is 30° and at 5:20 there is exacly a 5 minute space between the two hands.

42) `x = 12`
$$
M\angle AOC = 82
$$

$$
M\angle AOB = 32
$$

$$
M\angle BOC = 50
$$

45) `x = 7`
$$
M\angle AOB = 31
$$

$$
M\angle BOC = 49
$$

$$
M\angle AOD = 111
$$
