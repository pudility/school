### Math D

My name is Zoe Carver. My favotite thing to do outside of school is programming. This summer I had an internship doing back-end game desing for a company called Foundry10. We created a fantastic game that lets multiple people play together on their phones. It is a fighting game similar to Super Smash bros.. I also participate in the after school robotics program here at SAAS. Some things to know about me are, I really love donuts, I use he/him pronouns, I usually get to school early, and I have some acomodations such as using a keyboard, and other peoples notes.



I am very excited for geometry this year, thank you for being my teacher.
