### Summery:

Oddysius tells the story of finding the cyclops. He tells how the cyclops traps them inside his cave and eats two of oddysiuses men every meal. Then odysius plans an esape. He tells the cyclops that his name is no one and procedes to gouge the cyclops in the eye. Then when the cyclops yells out, he says no one is harming him. Odysus then sneeks out on the sheep and taunts the cyclops form his ship. The cyclops cursus odysus and says that if he ever returns home it will be without his crew, in someone elses ship, and come home to a disaster in his house.
