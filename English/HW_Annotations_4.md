- Why is he marring the son of Achilles?
- Why where people slaves, was it based on race?

45:

- this is the hospitatlity thing that we talked about in class
- its cazy that he just walks into someones house, takes a bath and gets rubbed down with oils, also why do they get rubbed down with oils?

46:

- he does not even know who he is, and yet he has already been bathed in his house.
- is he trying to be humble here, or is he trying to show off how much he has, I can't quite tell.

47:

- it seems like they cry more in Ancient Greece. 
- how did they cent the bedroom
- I don't understand how they braught a rug, what do they mean by this?

48:

- I cannot believe that they can recognize him

49:

- doesnt he already have his own country?
- Again, they cry so much back then

50:

- is helen really a god?
- does this drug *really* exist?

56:

- It would seem that lots of people talked to gods, I did not realize that people actually thought they talked to gods, I thought it was just something people told stories about.
- they cant possible think that they will catch a god
- it seems very un realistic that a human could catch a god, where these gods very difforent in power to the gods we have today?

67:

- does this mean that she will do anything with it? or did she just hear it?

68:

- that is really cool, I am begining to understand why the greeks liked their mythology so much.
- Oh, so that is what athena will do

69:

- so the gods can alter fate, but they cant get out of a fight with a human? (still I am glad that athena will protect her son)
