### Summary

Odysseus does what surcy tells him and goes to summon the dead. He then makes his sacrafices and the dead appear. He does all that surcy tells him and he learns what he needs to know. The profit tells him the exact adventure that he is on. He then stops his story so that he can go to bed however he is urged to continue and tell the storys of the men who fell in the battle of troy. He does this, and this is where the book leaves off.
