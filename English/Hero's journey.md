- Stage One **Call to adventure** - the hero leaves whatever they are doing so that they can go on an adventure. Example: Catness' sister is called to go to the hunger games and catneis volunteers.
- Stage Two ~~**the hero completes a set of challenges**~~ **initiation**  - the the hero compelts a set of challenges to prove there worth. Example: catness kills a rabet for dinner.
