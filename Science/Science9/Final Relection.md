1. I made one attempt at a design, that did not work. Then I made this design and another one after this design. I had to do 4 itterations of this design before I got this one.
2. I would use tin foil and I think I would work with our **original - original** design.
3. The hardest part was desiding what design to do. The next hardest part was making lots of difforent paper crafts, I am not very pacient so it was more dificult that I thought to fold each of these iterations.
