Atoms are composed of:

- protons 


- newtrons


- electrons

The number of protons are always the same as the number of electrons

Hydrogyn has one proton and one electron vs oxygen which has 8 of each.

## protons **+** 

## electrons **-**

#### Polar:

**separation of charges**

> parcial negative charge, parcial positive charge

inorder for something to be polar it has to be over a limit, ex:

​	Carbon 4 protons

​	Hydrogyn 1 proton

​	not enough difforence

> Like dessolves like

Ex:

popar disolves polar, nonpolar disolves non polar. 

Butter and oil will dissolve - sugar and water will dissolve.
