### Warm up

The fathre away from earth you are the less pressure there is. this makse it easeir for the water to boil in the same way that when you exapand a bottle of water it will also boil, because the pressure gets lower and for the opposite reason that compressed water turns into ice no matter the temperature.

1.  CO2
2. ~~becasue there was no oxygen.~~ The pressure was contained.
3. It is polar because it disolved in water
4. ~~Cold because water is larger when it is colder~~ Warmer becasue the pressure is heigher with more heat.

The CO2 **is** disolved becasue of pressure.

- I think that the air must have expanded when it got hot and then when it got cold agian it shurk and imploded the can.
- Or the HO2 gas takes up lots more space than the liquid, therfor when it turns back into liqid it takes up less space and implodes the can.
