### Summary:

- The first scientist to conseve of "climate change" was a John Tyndall in 1850.


- He did not think that it was a problem, he thought that it would take 3000 years for the earth to warm up as much as it is now and he thought that the ocean would obsorb the CO2.


- If the earth did not have greenhouse gasses, all of the oceans would freeze and it would reflect all of the radiation of the sun.
- Arrhenuis picked up where Tyndall left off - he became curios about the effects of CO2 because he was intrested in what caused the ice age.
- Arrhenuis did his caluclations in a way that seems "primative" but he got almost perfect results.
- Arrhemuis was the first to link the indusstrial revolution and the burning of coal to climate change
- in the 1950's Charels David started working on a new and more precise way of messuring CO2
  -  He set up an obserfitory in Hawaii and collected the most widely re-printed set of science data ever.
- David used this data to theorize that the ocean probably did not obsorb CO2 in the same wya that Tyndall throught it might.

### Questions:

1. *See summary above*
2. Greenhouse gasses can be seen with an infared camra, this means that they trap the suns heat and make our planet warmer. Other gasses like oxogyn cannot be seen with infared.
3. CO2 causes the planet to get warmer because the light cannot bounce out of the atmasfear. 
4. He thought that it would take a long time for CO2 to double in the atmosphere because the ocean would absorb it, however David Kelling proved this wrong.
