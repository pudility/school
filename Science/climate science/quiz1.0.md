### THINGS THAT I AM PRETTY SURE OF

- the ice is melting, this causes the oceans to contian more water which in turn makes them flood over the land. 
- the earth's atmosphere is sort-of like a greenhouse. The suns rays can get in to warm it, but they cannot get out. this is what causes the earth to heat up. 

### THINGS I AM NOT TOTALLY SURE ABOUT

- Another thing that causes earth to warm is ocean acidification. I am not exactly sure why, but I know that it has to do with the ocean obsorbing carbon (I think).

### THINGS I AM WONDERING ABOUT

- how do the molicules in the o-zone/atmisfeer only let in the rays and not let them out.
- how does the ocean obsorb co2/carbon and what does it absorb (I think it is either co2 or carbon but I am not quite sure)
