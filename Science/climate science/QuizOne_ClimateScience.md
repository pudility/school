1. Because the warmer waters increase the intensity of the hurricanes.
2. "Homogenizing" means that they get rid of in-valid data such as data taken with improper equipment. It is valid and it actually makes the data better and more acurate. It is valid because you are making the data better by getting rid of data that was not taken properly.
3. Because we see the ice sinking more than it has in **many** years.
4. The water kept rising because the ice that should have blocked it had melted. It has to do with climate change becuase the ice melted because of climate change.
5. In the Vostok graph it shows that we are in an inter-glasher period, this is one of the warmest periods the earth has and we have stayed in it longer than the 4 previos times we were in it. Both the Weather station data and the paleo climate data show that the earth is warming with an upward trend. If this trend continues our earth could reach heigher tempratures than ever before. The only time that the earth's temprature does not rise is during the 1940s-80 and this is becuase the smoke released by factorys blocked the sun from warming the planet. All these things together tell us that the planet is in fact warming and it is doing so very quickly. It is estimated that in 2080 all the ice could be melted during the summer, this would cuases problems not only for towns like shismarf but also for places like Florida where the sea levels will rise and cause major flooding.
